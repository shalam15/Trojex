we sttarted the program by coipying an pasting the code in nano 
and compiling but we ran into a "undefined reference to `sin'" error
so we google the error and we saw on stack overflow that we have to add the "-lm" flag inorder to include the math library in our excutable. It work after



file:///home/pi/sin%20error%20include%20-l.png

we copy and pasted the code for trap-working and ran it with the flag,
the answer we got was 
"OMP defined, threadct = 4
With 1048576 trapezoids, our estimate of the integral from 
0.000000 to 3.141593 is 1.487143"

file:///home/pi/running%20trap%20not%20working.png

which it think is wrogn because we were supposed to get 2.0



so we ran the trap-working.c code and we got the following result

"OMP defined, threadct = 4
With 1048576 trapezoids, our estimate of the integral from 
0.000000 to 3.141593 is 2.000000"

whihc gave us 2.0 the correct answer


to the next barrier.c programme

running the barrier.c with the line 31 commented out and awe got this out

Thread	1	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	1	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.
Thread	2	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	2	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.
Thread	3	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	3	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.
Thread	0	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	0	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.

this it with the line 31 uncommented out


Thread	1	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	0	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	2	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	3	of	4	is	BEFORE	the	barrier.
Thread	0	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.
Thread	1	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.
Thread	3	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.
Thread	2	of	4	is	AFTER	the	barrier.

the major difference it that the thread while the line is commented out is the thread 
is doing the before and the after, and after uncommenting it out, it does all tjhe before and then the after

now to the exercise:

after running the "gcc masterWorker.c -o masterWorker -fopenmp" while line 24 is commented out


we got the following result
Greetings	from	the	master,	#	0	of	1	threads


after uncommenting it we got:

Greetings	from	the	master,	#	0	of	4	threads
Greetings	from	a	worker,	#	1	of	4	threads
Greetings	from	a	worker,	#	2	of	4	threads
Greetings	from	a	worker,	#	3	of	4	threads
